Task 5  : Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective: Capture live packets, analyze them, and identify at least 3 different network protocols.

Tools Used:
Wireshark (latest version)
Windows 10 (testing environment)

Steps Performed:
Installed Wireshark and started capture on Wi-Fi interface.
Browsed websites (Google, Wikipedia) and pinged a server.
Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
Applied filters (dns, tcp, http) to analyze traffic.
Exported capture file as .pcap.

Protocols Identified:
DNS – Used for resolving domain names into IP addresses.
TCP – Connection-oriented communication (handshake observed).
HTTP/HTTPS – Web browsing traffic captured.

Screenshots:
DNS query packet
TCP handshake packet
HTTP GET request

Conclusion:
This task demonstrated how network packets can be captured and analyzed using Wireshark. It provided practical experience with filtering and identifying common protocols in real-time traffic.
